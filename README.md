# autoplaylist

A web app that autoplays custom-made online video playlists. So far this project is in its initial stage and is a work in progress. It does work though, and I continue to add to it as often as I can.

Right now, the only way to run a playlist is to import its JSON file. The end goal is to be able to create a playlist easily within the user interface. In the near future, I'll make this README a lot more detailed, including an explanation of all of the features and a description of the expected structure of a playlist JSON file.
